      "contents": "\nWhy is this important?\nDetecting non-human Twitter users has been of interest not only to\nElon Musk but also to academics. Indiana University has developed a free\nservice called Botometer, which scores Twitter handles\nbased on their likelihood of being a Twitterbot. Already in 2009,\nTwitter bots were estimated to create approximately 24% of tweets on\nTwitter. One academic study in 2017 estimated that up to\n15% of Twitter users were automated bot accounts. And the\nprevalence of Twitter bots coupled with the ability of some bots to give\nseemingly human responses has enabled these non-human accounts to garner\nwidespread influence, in both positive and negative\nways.\nThis project will address the question whether a specific\ntwitter dataset - consisting of all tweets mentioning #Drosten\nor @c_drosten in\nthe years 2020 and 2021 - contains bots and how they evolve over\ntime.\nFurthermore, the project wants to find out whether there is a certain\nemotionality in the tweets of the bots and whether this differs from the\nhuman like tweets.\nResearch Questions\nWhich percentage of the total number of tweets originate from\nbots and does this change as the pandemic progresses?\nAre bots and non-bots taking talking in a different\nvalence?\nThe data\nMethods\nBotometer\nStep [ ] Process all tweets by using the botometer API: https://botometer.osome.iu.edu\nStep [ ] Interpret the results and find a suited\nthreshold\nStep [ ] Analyse the results: Frequency and distribution over\ntime\nSentiment Analysis\nStep [ ] Perform Sentiment Analysis with the tweets indenified as\n“bot-like” vs “human-like”\nImplications\nThis small project attempts to contribute to the detection of\npossible bots in a Twitter dataset related to tweets mentioning\nChristian Drosten using #drosten or @c_drosten. It can provide us with\ninformation about the extent to which these Twitter hashtags\nhave been used by bots.\nIn addition, the value of bot tweets can tell us more about the\norigin and goals of the bots created and provide an answer to the\nquestion of whether bots were pushing certain\nissues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwordcloud visualisation (so\nfar)\n\n\n\nResults\nThreshold\n\n\n\nHow many Bots are in the\ndataset?\n\n\n\nSentiment\n\n\n\nLimitations\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n\n\n",
